# Bachelor Thesis (Bachelorproef)

InstantSearch.js is a library that enables developers to quickly make powerful search interfaces with the Algolia service. As a library that is used in a vanilla JavaScript environment, it works well without forcing a development model. When it is used in a situation where the existing application already are using a framework, it imposes limitations on its usage. To counter this, React InstantSearch and others are made, to integrate well within the programming model of frameworks. In this process a need for abstraction of the logic of search components is felt. Filling this void with a new library called InstantSearch Core is the goal of this thesis.

To acquire sufficient knowledge of the challenges that are encountered, a preliminary study is executed. The website of Yarn now allows developers to find which dependencies to use, while also displaying rich statistics on each packageâ€™s detailed view. Knowledge is also acquired by maintaining and supporting the existing libraries of Algolia.
