\chapter{Acknowledgements}% (fold)
\label{chp:acknowledgements}

First of all I want to thank everyone at Algolia for helping me in several ways, be it by reviewing, reading or just general knowledge they gave me. In particular I'd like to thank Vincent Voyer for being a great mentor that absolutely cares about what I make. I'd like to thank as well Kevin Granger, Sylvain Utard and everyone else that helped with the Yarn project, which really kickstarted my internship and research. I also want to thank everyone else in the JavaScript team, Alex Stanislawski, Marie-Laure Thuret, Maxime Janton -- and also Raymond Rutjes -- for all tips and tricks that helped me during my internship and my project. 

I also want to thank everyone that helped me when making Yarn, working at Facebook: Daniel Lo Nigro, James Kyle, Christoph Pojer, Konstantin Raev and Sebastian McKenzie, as well as other people contributing, among which Espen Henriksen, Ken Sin and a lot more.

I also want to thank Eva Naudts, Joris Maervoet and everyone else reading or reviewing, for finding all my mistakes.
