As described earlier, InstantSearch Core\cite{is-core} is not a replacement of the currently existing \acrshortpl{api}, but rather a modularisation. 

Because of this, InstantSearch Core can be used as a similar --- but slightly more time saving --- as the JavaScript Helper. This exercise has been done for a {\tt RefinementList} to provide a similar \acrshort{api} as InstantSearch.js and React InstantSearch. This exercise is available on the project page of InstantSearch Core on GitHub~\cite{is-core}~.
