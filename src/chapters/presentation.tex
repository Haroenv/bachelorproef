Algolia\cite{algolia-home} is a company founded in Paris, but now has its headquarters in San Fransisco, US, although most of the development happens in Paris. The goal is to help people discover content they want to find, which is achieved by a SaaS search offering.

People upload their data onto Algolia’s infrastructure, where the data is split up into n-grams\cite{kimbrell1988searching}. This results in a nested datastructure that’s very fast to search in and has features like typo-tolerance, faceting etc. at the cost of a slightly higher indexing time (a few seconds to a minute).\cite{paris-nlp-algolia}

The story doesn’t end there, because developer experience (DX) is held in a very high standard at Algolia. There are API clients for a lot of languages5. In JavaScript and mobile the offering goes further than that, by offering what’s called instantsearch\cite{instantsearch-js}\cite{react-instantsearch}\cite{instantsearch-android}\cite{instantsearch-ios}. These are a set of libraries orchestrating all parts of a good search experience.

\section{Work environment}
\label{sec:work-environment}

Algolia is divided into several ``squads''. The engineering squads are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item empowerment
  \item enablement
  \item design
  \item foundation
  \item website
  \item infra
  \item intelligence
\end{enumerate}

My internship is in the ``empowerment'' squad. This is the squad that is responsible for all API clients and libraries that make working with them easier. This is in contrast with the enablement squad, which makes complete integrations of Algolia in frameworks like Wordpress\cite{algolia-wordpress} and Magento\cite{algolia-magento}.

The foundation squad works on the Algolia engine, logging and related activities, closely together with the infra(structure) squad.
