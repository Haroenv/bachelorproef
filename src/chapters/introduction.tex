The mission of the internship is divided in two parts. The first is getting to know our libraries by using them in a large production website. The second is finding a way to easily make InstantSearch for a multitude of frameworks.

The place to discover all nooks and crannies of instantsearch that was chosen is the Yarn website~\cite{yarn-site}. Yarn is a package manager built on top of npm~\cite{npm-github}. It has been built from the ground up with a new registry, mirroring all changes to npm, and with a new client that only supports modern environments.

In the end of December, Algolia launched search on the Yarn website by replicating this registry again, but this time in an Algolia index. A search experience in InstantSearch.js was added~\cite{yarn-pr-add-algolia} at that time, and was live about a week later. To make this experience better --- after a meeting with core team members of the Yarn project --- the decision was made to improve how and where the search was, as well as making a detail page.

The second goal is making {\tt instantsearch-core}. Instantsearch.js was released in 2015, which was built on top of the helper~\cite{algolia-js-helper} directly, and called the methods to refine at helper-level.

When {\tt react-instantsearch}~\cite{react-instantsearch} was released, the need for another layer of abstraction was identified. Users don't need to know which exact facet or which helper method is being called, even when making custom {\tt connectors}\cite{react-instantsearch-connectors}. While {\tt react-instantsearch} is still making use of the helper, a second layer~\cite{react-instantsearch-search-state} of state has been made.

The second goal of this internship is writing a layer of abstraction --- that doesn't use the helper --- to set state based on widgets and asks Algolia for the results of a certain ``widget configuration''. The result of this will allow for more rapid development of instantsearch for frameworks other than React.
