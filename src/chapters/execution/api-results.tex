\section{Getting responses from the \acrshort{api}} % (fold)
\label{sec:getting_responses_from_the_api}

Until now, all state operations only applied to the local view, but no \acrshort{api} calls have been made. Since Algolia queries are called via its \acrshort{api}, it's very important that these \acrshort{api} calls will happen as soon as something in the query state changes. 

A subscription to the main state is made to make sure that every time the state changes, a new \acrshort{api} request can be done. Once this request fulfils, a function called {\tt \_\_setResults} can be called with the new values that are returned from the API.

To be able 

another function listens to changes in state %%

it transforms params into a JS client request

it replaces the {\tt response} in the state with an action
