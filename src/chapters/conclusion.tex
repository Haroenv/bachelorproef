\section{Discussion}

Doing an internship at Algolia proved to be a very meaningful experience for me. Not only have I learned a lot about programming, from the deep questions Sepehr Fakour asked me from time to time to the day-to-day discovery of new things, but I also learned a lot about how to work in a community.

Working in a community is meant twofold. Algolia as a company is very much focused on its core values, which causes one to take part in a lot of different environments, far from the task that originally would be assigned.

Working on a product that actually is used by a lot of people is very humbling, you realise that every action you do will have an impact. When you accidentally break a build of a library, people will know, but they will also know when you fix a bug they've been having.

Deciding to focus the internship on learning as much as possible on the solutions that already are in place to solve problems Algolia has opened my eyes in understanding paradigms that when trying to understand them earlier, went over my head.

Contributing on the search experience and detail page of Yarn has been, and is one of the biggest single contributions I've done to a project that didn't start out as mine. It's very interesting to see people's opinion on your work, as well as finding how to fit in what you're making with what already exists.

By doing this internship in a city where I've never been a long time before, as well as being independent for a significant period of time has been another great life experience for emotional development, rather than cognitive. Doing this internship has convinced me that I'm capable of continuing to live in Paris, and continuing to have a great time.
